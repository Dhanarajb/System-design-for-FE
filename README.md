# Why system design for Front-End?

Front-End is getting complex day by day.The line between Backend and Front-End is fading out. As well as, it is expected that Front-End should contribute to the design decisions of the project. Front-End developers should flag in the design meetings if Backend/APIs folks are ignoring any important aspect in the design.

# What interviewers are looking for?

As a Front-End developer do you understand

1. How the application should be designed E2E?
2. What are the important parts of any application?
3. Do you understand which resource is the right fit and why
4. Do you understand the pros-cons of the design decisions
5. Do you understand what is required from the backend/APIs folks to make your Front-End
6. Do you understand the cost (price) of designing an application and how to optimize it?
7. Are you able to design a micro-service
8. Are you able to design micro-frontends
