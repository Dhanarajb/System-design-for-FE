# Why system design for Front-End?

Front-End is getting complex day by day.The line between Backend and Front-End is fading out. As well as, it is expected that Front-End should contribute to the design decisions of the project. Front-End developers should flag in the design meetings if Backend/APIs folks are ignoring any important aspect in the design.

How the application should be designed E2E?
